# FPS HORROR

This game was made for my friend logan. All of the programing was done by me.


# Installation

To install my game, you will need to go to [the latest release](https://github.com/Sebimmortal/FPS-horror/releases/tag/windows). After installing, you just need to open the .exe file and you are all done.

Have Fun!
