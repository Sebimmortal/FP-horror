# FP HORROR

This game was made for my friend logan. All of the programing was done by me.


## Installation

To install my game, you will need to go to [the latest release](https://github.com/Sebimmortal/FPS-horror/releases/tag/V0.1.0). Click on the .zip folder with the name of the platform you use. This will cause it to start downloading. After it is done downloading, extract the .zip and then just run the .exe.

Have Fun!
